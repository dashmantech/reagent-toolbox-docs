# Reagent Toolbox Docs

A mix of documentation and demo of all the [Reagent Toolbox](https://github.com/dashmantech/reagent-toolbox) 
capabilities. You can visit a live instance of this project at http://reagent-toolbox-docs.dashman.tech/ The goal of 
this project is to be a ClojureScript/Reagent version of the [components page](http://react-toolbox.com/#/components)
for [React Toolbox](http://react-toolbox.com).

This project is far from done and what we are doing is go page by page, building the showcase of each component and in
the process making sure the component works well. Sometimes it's necessary to improve the basic component a little bit
to make it more compatible with Reagent. All of this is being tracked in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dashmantech/reagent-toolbox-docs/issues).
